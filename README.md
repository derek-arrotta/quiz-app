# Quiz App

This is a fun little quiz app I built with just 5 questions. Starts on a home screen where you click "start", and then go through multiple choice questions, where right/wrong feedback is given at each step.

## Technology

Used render and event handling methods to go from question to question.
* Javascript, HTML, CSS
